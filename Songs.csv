Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type

They used to say to get a man, you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man, you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
